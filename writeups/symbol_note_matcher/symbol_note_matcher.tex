A transaction \T is an object consisting of
\begin{description}
	\item[$s$] a symbol
	\item[$w_i$] a sequence of words, $i=1,2,\ldots,n$
	\item[$t$] a enum "type"
\end{description}

We are given a sequence of transactions $(\T)$ where the symbol is missing.  This algorithm will match transactions with missing symbols to transactions with similar sequences of words.

Let $f(s)=\{\T_s\}$ be the set of all \T with symbol $s$
