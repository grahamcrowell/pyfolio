Allocation Error:\\
Consider a portfolio of $N$ assets.  Let $x_t=(x_{i,t})_{i=1}^N\in\R^N_+$ be the price vector of portfolio's assets at time $t$ and let $n=(n_i)_{i=1}^N\in\N^N$ be the number of units held of each asset.  Consider a desired \emph{allocation vector} $\alpha=(\alpha_i)_{i=1}^N\in\R^N_+$ such that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \alpha_i = 1$.\\
We can define the \emph{allocation error} as the root squared error at time $t$ as $RSE_t=\left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{n_ix_{i,t}}{\dot{n,x}} - \alpha_i \right) \right]^2$.\\
